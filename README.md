# The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Web Accessibility
Welcome to the **The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Web Accessibility** Zeitspace Session!
Let's make sure you're all set up.

## Setup

* Download the project files in this Github repository, by clicking the `Clone or Download` and then `Download ZIP`. This file contains all the materials for this workshop.

* Extract the ZIP file.

### Optional tools
Adobe XD is a design and prototyping tool. It is not required for this workshop but you are welcome to use it. We provide both Adobe XD assets and corresponding flattened PNG images. A trial of Adobe XD can be [downloaded from the Adobe site](http://creative.adobe.com/products/download/xd).

## Activity 1

The goal of this activity is to learn about structure as it relates to accessible design.

We'll provide a physical printout of a web page to work with for Activity 1. (We've also provided a PNG image of the web page in case you'd like to try this exercise again later.)

Using the physical printout, think about the different sections of the web page. Are there clear separations between different types of content? Can the sections you identify be assigned a landmark role?

## Activity 2

Two types of assets are provided for Activity 2.

* Adobe XD document. This contains the design for the web page
* Web page (including the necessary HTML, CSS, and image files)

In many cases, accessibility issues span design and development. Using the assets provided, identify accessibility issues and decide how to solve them in the design, the implementation, or both.
